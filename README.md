## Workshop 1 - Into to Unity & Shaders: Cozy Yard Work
Add Unity to your toolbox by installing it and creating a fresh 3D URP project from scratch. Build
a cozy garden scene and implement reusable player + camera movement. Finish with shader
fundamentals and use Shader Graph to bring your terrain to life, using fragments 😱

## Workshop 2 Plant Something: Buttons, Plots, and Growing
Turn plots into real interactables with simple states (Empty - Seed - Ready). Let the player
press E to plant while standing on a plot, and make interaction readable with a clear
highlight/glow. Make plants feel alive with simple growth + gentle wind controls.

## Workshop 3 Harvest & Earn: Coins, Goals, and Effects
Complete the core loop: harvest Ready plants, earn coins, and track progress toward a win goal.
Add simple UI for coins/harvest count and a basic win screen. Make it satisfying with particle
effects for harvesting, coin gain, and a bigger win celebration.

## Workshop 4 Make It Feel Cozy: Sound, Menus, and Better Look
Upgrade the prototype into a cohesive mini-game: basic menu + restart, small “ready” pop
animation, and cozy SFX/music. Introduce materials + lighting (PBR basics) and do a quick
lighting pass so the garden reads clean and consistent.

## Workshop 5 Build Like a Pro: Tooling + High-End Shader Effects
Learn practical “real project” workflow: useful packages, profiling basics, and exporting builds.
Then go advanced on graphics by integrating a prepared raymarch/SDF shader effect and
tuning controls (color, glow, fog, speed) so everyone leaves with a signature visual for portfolio.
